This tutorial assumes you are completely new to Ankr, but that you want to get applications and API keys to use with Rollux.


## Register

The first step is to register for a free Ankr account.

1. Browse [to Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/) then click **Sign up**.

1. You can choose from two methods to sign up; Google or your ETH wallet. We recommend using your Ethereum wallet and this guide is based on that.

1. Select the wallet you are using. In this example we are using Metamask.

1. Once your Ankr account is ready and connected to your wallet, you will see the following account buttons at the top-right of the page.

1. Now scroll through the different networks available and select the one you want. In this example we use **Rollux testnet**.
